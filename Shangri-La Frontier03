THAT WAS DEFINITELY WHAT HIS PLAYER NAME READ...

I THINK THE SNAKE POISONED
HIM.

HE WAS MAKING A MAD DASH FOR SECONDIL

AND HE WAS A HALF-NAKED MAN WITH A BIRD MASK?

HE MUST'VE CHANGED IT BY NOW. BUT...

YEAH THAT IASK HAD REAL SCARY EYES!

BUT THAT EMBLEM ON HIS CAPE...

I THINK IT'S A CLAN CHASING...

..THE UNIQUE MONSTER "LYCAON THE NIGHT- SLAYER."

"UNIQUE MONSTER?"

A "UNIQUE MONSTER" IS JUST THAT-

A MONSTER THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE OF IN THE ENTIRE GAME WORLD

IF YOU CATCH OR DEFEAT A REGULAR MONSTER...

IT'LL REAPPEAR LATER ON AFTER SOME TIME PASSES

BUT WITH A UNIQUE MONSTER THERE'S NO REPLACING ANY OF THEM.

G.L.F.IS RUMOREDTO HAVEGEVEN UINIQUE MONSTERS

BUT THE THING IS,THEY'RE ALL SUPER STRONG.

THEREARE OVER THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE PLAYING THIS
GAME...

A UNIQUE MONSTER...

GUESS IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.
