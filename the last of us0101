<i>And that's your biggest worry?</i>
<i>Yes, any kind of virus, but most probably</i>  <i>something similar to influenza.</i>
1968
<i>Because of air travel.</i>
<i>Through the air.</i>
-Coughing--  -I'm sorry.
I meant people. On planes.
That was something  you described in your book.
Yes, a new virus in Madagascar, say,
could be in Chicago  within a matter of weeks.
And we end up with a global pandemic.  Pan meaning "all."
The whole world becomes sick all at once.
And, Dr. Neuman,  you're also an epidemiologist.
I presume the prospect of a viral pandemic  keeps you up at night as well.
-No.  -No?
-No.  -All right, well, that's our show.
No, mankind has been at war with the virus  from the start.
Sometimes, millions of people die,  as in an actual war.
But in the end, we always win.
But you-- just to be clear, you do think  microorganisms pose a threat.
In the most dire terms.
-Bacteria.  -No.
-You like saying no.  -Yes.
Not bacteria. Not viruses.
-So?  -Fungus.
Yes, that's the usual response.
Fungi seem harmless enough.
Many species know otherwise.
Because there are some fungi  who seek not to kill,
but to control.
Let me ask you,  where do we get LSD from?
Where do you get it from?
It comes from ergot, a fungus.
Psilocybin? Also a fungus.
Viruses can make us ill,  but fungi can alter our very minds.
There's a fungus that infects insects.
Gets inside an ant, for example,
travels through its circulatory system  to the ant's brain,
and then floods it with hallucinogens,
thus bending the ant's mind to its will.
The fungus starts  to direct the ant's behavior,
telling it where to go, what to do,
like a puppeteer with a marionette.
And it gets worse.
The fungus needs food to live,
so it begins to devour  its host from within,
replacing the ant's flesh with its own,
but it doesn't let its victim die.
No, it keeps its puppet alive  by preventing decomposition.
How? Where do we get penicillin from?
Fungus.
Dr. Schoenheiss, you're in distress.
Fungal infection of this kind is real,  but not in humans.
True, fungi cannot survive
if its host's internal temperature  is over 94 degrees.
And currently, there are no reasons  for fungi to evolve
to be able to withstand  higher temperatures.
But what if that were to change?
What if, for instance,
the world were to get slightly warmer?
Well, now there is reason to evolve.
One gene mutates and an ascomycete,  candida, ergot,
cordyceps, aspergillus,  any one of them could become
capable of burrowing into our brains
and taking control not of millions of us,  but billions of us.
Billions of puppets with poisoned minds
permanently fixed on one unifying goal:
to spread the infection  to every last human alive
by any means necessary.
And there are no treatments for this.
No preventatives, no cures.
They don't exist.  It's not even possible to make them.
So, if that happens?
We lose.
We'll be back.
THE LAST OF US
2003
Alarm.
Alarm!
-Where's the pancake mix?  -Oh, was I--
Yeah, I was. Sorry.
I was gonna make you birthday pancakes.
I swear.
You know I don't really like pancakes.
I know you don't like them.  It was for my benefit.
Vitamin C.
You get your homework done?
Fractions?
How old are you again?
Thirty-six.
Gonna have to wear diapers soon.
Who says I don't already?
Shell.
Calcium.
Lovely.
Is there enough for Uncle Tommy?
Well, there would've been.
You're still alive, you old fucker.
Aw. He loves you.
He's dependent on me. Not the same.
-I think it's the same.  -It's definitely the same.
I thought we was havin' pancakes.
We'll pick you somethin' up on the road.
-Concrete guys gonna be there?  -Yeah, they said maybe.
Maybe? We can't frame until we pour.
We're not gettin' paid until we frame.
Well, we could bring someone else on,
-get the job done faster.  -No, no.
I'm not splittin' this job.
I barely wanna split it with you.
We could work a double.
-Literally? Today?  -I know. I'd be done by nine.
By nine, right?
Yeah.
I'll bring back a cake.
I promise.
<i>...continued disturbances in Jakarta,</i>
<i>but are advising U.S. citizens...</i>
Jakarta. Where is that, Middle East?
Doesn't ring a bell.  It's definitely a country.
-Or maybe part of Asia?  -Jakarta isn't a country.
Being a part of Asia isn't mutually  exclusive with being a country,
and in fact,  it's the capital of Indonesia.
Shit. Hope for us yet.
All right.
Finish up quick, we'll drop you off.
-I'm still eating my eggshells.  -You got seven minutes.
Your t-shirt's inside out.
Shit.
He's losin' it.
Sarah!
Hey, neighbor!
Oh, Hi.
Connie was askin' after you,  since you haven't been over in a while.
Make 'em happy.
I could come by after school,  but just for, like,
-a little bit?  -She'll take whatcha got.
Y'all can bake, whatever.
Speakin' of,
we got a lotta extra here.
Y'all want some biscuits?
Dad, you love biscuits.
I do.
But I'm on Atkins.
-On what now?  -It's, you know what?
We gotta run, but Sarah'll be by later.
She'll stay as long as you want.
Tell ya all about Atkins.
Great! I'll let Connie know.
Solid.
Can't tell you how exciting it was  listenin' to that fuckin' conversation.
Put that out.
Happy birthday to you.

-There you are, sweetie.  -Sorry.
I was gettin' worried.
I was getting something for my dad.
Hi, Mercy.
Hey, is everything okay?  Like, on the news?
Like what, hon?
Well, no, there was just a lot of police  and stuff on the road today.
Well, that's true every day, innit?
People out there need  to get right with Jesus.
Three nails, plus one cross,  equals four-given.
I was thinkin' we'd make some cookies.
Chocolate chip?

C'mon, Mama. It's green.
You love that.
Here we go!
I don't know why I talk to her.
She's completely deaf.
You wanna give me a hand?
Be right there!
Hey, Mrs. Adler?
Could I borrow this?
Yeah, sure.
It's one of Danny's.
You know what?  My dad's gonna be back real soon.
-I should go.  -You sure?
-Yeah.  -Well, you're takin' some cookies.

Good job.
Yeah.
-It's 10.  -I know.
They gave us the wrong size  for the headers.
That doesn't mean anything to ya.  I'm sorry.
Where's the cake?
-Shit.  -C'mon, man.

Swear, or you don't get your present.
-You got me a present?  -Swear.

Wow.
Fixed it for you.
-Did you?  -What?
I don't hear anything.
That was lame.
-You're lame.  -Yeah, I know.
Where'd you get the money for this?
Drugs. I sell hardcore drugs.
It's better than what I do.
It was only $20, which I stole from you.
I could've stolen 60,  but I put the change back
because I'm an honest thief.
Besides, it's the thought that counts.
And you were never gonna  do it for yourself, so.
Thank you.
There's one more.
-Borrowed it from the Adlers.  -This is the one with the deleted scenes.
"ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES  I'VE EVER SEEN"
Yeah, imagine how bad those have to be.
C'mon, pop it in.  While it's still your birthday.
-Don't fall asleep.  -'Course, I won't.
It's too riveting.
Hello?

HOSPITAL
-Daddy--  -We don't know.
They're saying it's a virus.  Some kind of parasite.
Is it from terrorists?
We don't know.
-Are we sick?  -No. Of course not.
Why did things blow up?
No cellphone, no radio.
Minute ago, newsman wouldn't shut up.
-How do you know?  -What?
How do you know we're not sick?
They're saying it's mostly  people in the city.
That's why they got  the highway blocked off.
God.
It's Jimmy's place.
The Adlers would take Nana into the city.
To the hospital for stuff.
That's right. They would.  That's probably why.
But, you'd have to go a lot, right?
We're fine. Trust me.
All right.
Here! Right here!
-Hey!  -What are you doin'?
-Got a kid, Joel.  -So do we. Keep driving.
We could put them in the back.
Somebody else'll come along.
Fuck! Everybody had the same fuckin' idea.
I can't get through this.
All right. Let's think it through,  we'll think it through.
-Fuck!  -All right, take the field.
We cut across  and we pick up on the west side.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  West, west, all right.
All right, hang on.
Shit! Fuckin' army.
-Isn't that good?  -It's good for them,
but that's the highway  we're tryin' to get to.
All right, keep movin'. Head north.
-Could be a lotta people.  -Well, we can't go south,
we can't go east, we can't go west.
Hell else we supposed to go?
Tommy, come on!
Yeah.
Yeah, I know that place.
-This can work.  -Yeah, but then what?
I don't know. Mexico.  Just far, far as we can.
-How much gas?  -Three-quarter tank.
Go through town, golf course by the river,  straight across,
we pick up the highway  on the other side of the blockade,
then we're out.
Maybe it's everywhere.
Maybe there's nowhere to go.
What the fuck?!
Son of a bitch. Gotta go around.
Grab somethin'!
All right, keep goin', keep goin'.
Shit. Tommy!
Tommy, you can't stop here.
-I can't drive through 'em all.  -Are you serious?
Just keep goin'!
Go, go, go. Back, back, back,
-back, back, back, back!  -I'm trying!
Tommy, go faster!  We gotta go!
I'm tryin'!  There's nowhere to fuckin' go!
-Find an alley!  -What alley?
-There's people everywhere!  -Roll the fuck over them!
We gotta get off this street now!
That's what I'm tryin' to do, Joel.
We're gonna be okay. Just keep drivin'.
Dad?
Holy shit!
Move. Move!
Sarah, Sarah.
Stay right there. Don't move.
Tommy, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Sarah, don't look.
You look at me, okay?
I'm sorry, baby, I know, I know.
Come here.  Put your arms around me.
Come here, come here.
I got you. I got you.
Got you.
Are you okay?  Are you okay?
-My ankle.  -All right, okay.
We gotta get off the street!  Shit!
Tommy?!
Tommy?
Tommy!
Head to the river! I'll find a way.
Get her outta here, Joel! Go!
-We can't leave him.  -He'll be fine.
-Can you run?  -No.
-You keep your eyes on me.  -Okay.
-Okay?  -Okay.
And don't look anywhere else.
Alright.
It's okay, baby. You're safe.
Don't move!
-My daughter's hurt. Her ankle.  -Stop right there!
Okay.
Easy now. We're not sick!
I got two civilians by the river,  one of 'em injured.
Ankle.
What about Uncle Tommy?
We're gonna get you somewhere safe first.
Then we'll go back for him, okay?
-Okay.  -Okay.
I'm sorry, repeat?
Hey! No one told you to move.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
We're not sick.
Sir,
we are not sick!
I'm sorry.
Please, don't.
Oh God.
No. Oh no.
No, no. No.
Okay, You're okay.
You're okay.  Move your hand, baby.
Move your hand.
I know, baby, I know,  I know, I know, I know.
I know it hurts.
Alright.  Don't look down, look up, look up.
Come on, baby. You're okay, you're okay.
I know, I know, I know,  I know, baby, I know, I know.
I know this hurts.
You're gonna be okay.
All right, baby, baby, baby, listen to me.
I gotta get you up, okay?  I gotta get you up.
All right? You come on.
You come on. I know, baby.
No, no. I know, I know, I know,  I know, I know, I know.
Tommy, help me!
Joel.
C'mon, baby girl.
C'mon, baby girl, I gotta get you up.

I'm sorry.
Well,
how about we just let it go?
What else are you gonna do?
Ya gonna keep me here?
-Kill me?  -Tess, c'mon.
Then, Robert, what do ya want?
I want you to forget this ever happened.
Done.
-Don't do that.  -What?
It's just a truck battery.  I paid you for it,
you sold it to someone else,  and you spent my money.
I mean, you think I've  never done shit like that?
-My guys fucked you up.  -Yeah, so discipline them.
You cut off a finger  or whatever the fuck you want.
I don't care. They're your fuckin' guys.
What about your guy?  'Cause when he sees you,
-I mean, put yourself in my shoes.  -Look, he answers to me.
So, I give you my word  that he won't hurt you.
I'll tell him that  I got jumped by some guys,
and then you and I  can just move the fuck on.
Now your shit has pretty much  ruined my week,

People from FEDRA. You hear me?
Let me out or you're gonna pay,  motherfuckers!
I'm not supposed to be here!
WHEN YOU'RE LOST IN THE DARKNESS
Hey, there's a line!
"Tell Dad it's a girl.
"That would be good, right?
"He wanted a granddaughter.
Love, Becca."
End message. Read back.
Correct, 73-K Orlando. Out.
Nothin'?
Is there any chance  it's comin' in at night?
You're sleepin', you miss it?
When I'm sleeping, Gabriela listens,  or my son.
The smart one, not the other one,  God bless him.
If Tommy responded, we'd know.
-And you're talkin' to the tower?  -Every day.
They gave him your message,  they haven't seen or heard
from him since, and that's it.
-It hasn't been that long.  -It's been three weeks.
It's never taken him  more than a day to respond.
I'm sure he's okay.
Show me where the tower is.
You can't be serious.
Joel, it's in Wyoming.
All this open country?
I mean, you're a capable guy,
but there are worse things  than Infected out there.
I hear everything on this.
There are raiders, there are slavers--
But you're "sure" Tommy's okay?
It's the Cody tower...
Q-Bar 4, but I don't know exactly wh--
Next!
<i>You know what, Joel...</i>
<i>Joel!</i>
I got jumped by a couple guys.
-What guys?  -Just a couple teenagers.
Said some shit, probably shouldn't've.
Come on. You know these guys  were born after the outbreak.
Never learned how to argue.  They just start swingin'.
Fuckin' 19-year-old pieces of shit.
It's a miracle you're alive.
It's a miracle any of us are alive.
These aren't new.
No.
I was in FEDRA lockup all day.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
-I need you to take a breath.  -What?
-Joel--  -What?
The guys who jumped me were with Robert.
He sold our battery to someone else.
Nothing's lost.  Shit like this is gonna happen.
Now we just shake it off,
and we go get our cards back,  or the battery.
I need the battery, Tess.
Truck's no good without one,
and if I don't get to Tommy soon,  he's gonna die out there.
Okay, fuck it.
We get our money back  and the battery.
But, Joel, listen,
Robert is terrified of you.
So, you march outta here  all Clint Eastwood,
he's gonna get wind of it and skip.
I need you to take a breath.
-Who'd he sell it to?  -Don't know.
-Well, where is he?  -Don't know.
Yet.
But we're gonna find out, quietly.
Understand?
Now I promised Robert  that you wouldn't hurt him.
But I would very much  like for you to hurt him.
So let's go hunt that motherfucker down,
and get our battery and our truck,
and then we'll go find Tommy.
All right?
All right.
The team in place at Southeast 3?
I held them back.
I have some questions.
Okay.
We've been blowing up  meaningless FEDRA targets
spread out all over the QZ, for two weeks.
We've already lost four people,  and we're--
What's the point of this?
Is that your question?
That's one of them.
My answer is to follow fuckin' orders.
And why do you have some random girl  locked in a room?
And the guys you have guarding her  won't tell me shit?
Our people are asking what's going on,  and I don't know what to tell them.
Tell them to follow fuckin' orders.
You two, go to Southeast 3. Now.
-Kim.  -Marlene.
We are in a war  against a military dictatorship
to restore democracy and freedom.
Does that sound about right?
-Yes?  -Are we winning?
Are we beating FEDRA here?
Are the Fireflies beating FEDRA anywhere?
-Rebellion takes time.  -You fight for 20 years
and you get nowhere,  you're not a rebellion.
Just spray paint.
We're not hitting FEDRA "all over" the QZ.
We hit 'em here, here, here, here, here.
Where are we right now?
I want FEDRA everywhere but here.
I want them as distracted as possible  because tonight,
every Firefly in Boston  is gonna gather in this building,
and we are gonna leave the QZ.  Permanently.
-We're quitting?  -No.
We're taking that random girl  locked in that room west.
From our guy in the radio tower in Salem.
Is this real?
I believe it is.
Keep it quiet.
Whatever you need.
Whatever it takes.
We'll get her where she needs to go.
Hey, friend.
Don't worry. I don't want anything.
But if you're feelin' lost--
You tell me to "look for the light"  and I'll break your jaw.
Well, it cost us a couple of cards,  but we got him.
He's supposedly takin' the battery  to a red-tagged building.
But get this,  corner of Stillman and Cross.
The one Miguel used to use.
Yeah, I'm thinkin' so.
We can take the subway tunnel  under Haymarket,
get into the building from below,  and take Robert by surprise.
Pay this fucker back.
Oh, my God.
Agh! You fucker!
One, two, three, four--
You're not scared.
Then unlock me.
How about we start with "thank you"?
For what?
For saving your life?
I am the one who told 'em  not to shoot you,
-if you recall.  - Yeah.
Why did you stop them?
We'll get to that.
So, Veronica,
how ya feelin'?
The same.
Is it gonna happen?
No.
So, can I go?
No.
I won't tell anyone about any of this.
I swear.
Where you gonna go?
Back to FEDRA military school?
-You that anxious to be a soldier?  -You think I chose that place?
They put me there when I was a baby.
It's for orphans.
"They" didn't put you there.
I did.
Ellie.
You my fucking mom or something?
Do I look like your mom?
Nooo, you do not.
My name is Marlene.
I'm the leader of the Fireflies  in the Boston QZ.
Why would a terrorist dump me with FEDRA?
Because it's where you'd be safest,  and you were safe there
until you decided to sneak out.
And "terrorist"?
Was Riley a terrorist?
Why won't you let me go home?
Because you have a greater purpose  than any of us could've ever imagined.
So we're leaving tonight,  and we're taking you with us.
-He's here.  -Five minutes.
What I'm about to tell you  cannot be repeated to anyone.
Because if you do, I assure you
you will die.
HAYMARKET ACCESS 838
Okay.
Ready?
Yeah.
That's the one.
Oh fuck.
Oh shit.
This one's done.
Yeah.
I know. I just--
I wasn't expecting it.
Take it he wasn't down here last time?
No.
You think he came down  after he was infected?
Well, maybe down here  is where he was infected.
Let's keep movin'.
It's like they reframed  the whole structure.
Probably in the '80s.
Everyone was cutting down  on apartment sizes
to sell more condos.
"This has been 'Construction Corner'  with Joel Miller."
How far up we goin'?
This far.
So, this opens into the hallway.
What the fuck?  Someone put a piano in front of this?
You smell that?
Yeah, gunpowder.
Tess.
Well, the battery's no good.
And he still tried to sell it.
Twice.
You greedy fuck.
Shit.
Oh God.
Shit, come on.
Fuck.
Joel?
Marlene?
-You okay?  -Yeah.
Ellie.
Ellie!
-Oh shit!  -No, it's okay. I'll be all right.
And you can't be stupid like this.
So this is who Robert  screwed us over with?
The Che Guevara of Boston?
War must be goin' pretty shitty
for you to be buying  from scumbags like him.
Yeah, it kinda has been.
The merch was bad,
and he obviously didn't take "fuck off"  for an answer.
-Gimme my knife.  -What do you need a car battery for?
-Don't.  -Not at her.
Point it at me.
And to answer your question,  I need it for a better reason than you do.
No offense, but Tommy's just one man.
-It's our business to know things.  -"To know things."
You're the cause of it.  You turned my own brother against me.
-Okay, Joel.  -That was a lot of gunfire.
-FEDRA's gonna be on the way.  -I know.
We were gonna move Ellie  outta the zone tonight.
But we won't make it anywhere like this.  Not for a while anyway.
So now I'm thinkin', you're gonna do it.
-The hell we are.  -I'm not goin' with them!
-Let me take her.  -Tess, we don't have time for this.
You don't have time?
-Who is she?  -To you? She's cargo.
We don't smuggle people. Sorry.
-I can do it.  -Kim, you don't have
a fuckin' ear on your fuckin' head.
Could you please?
There's a team of Fireflies  waiting for her at the old State House.
I know what's out there.
We were going with an entire squadron  for that very reason.
But now I don't have a truck,  I don't have a squadron,
FEDRA's five minutes away.
What I do have is you.
And I know what you're both capable of.
For better or worse.
What are they capable of?
You get her there safely,  and they'll give you what you need.
Not just a battery. The whole thing.
Fueled-up truck, guns,  supplies, all of it.
I swear.
I swear.
Asshole!
You trust her?
No, me neither, but she seems desperate.
Firefly vehicle usually means  repurposed FEDRA stuff.
So better-than-decent chance  makin' it to Tommy in one of those.
The second we hand that kid over--
Y'all talk it through,  but please remember that I'm bleeding out.
Okay. Here's the deal.
We'll get her to your crew  at the State House.
But before we hand her over,  they give us everything that we want.
If not, we kill her, there and then.
-Deal.  -Really? That fast?
You are all that matters.
My team will not jeopardize that.
Remember what I told you?
Now go get your backpack.
Now, Ellie.
Let's go.
Joel,
don't fuck this up.
Please.
Give us a minute, all right?
What the fuck?!
So, what's the plan?
There's not a lot of options.
There's the short way or the long way.
The short way is pretty much...
That leaves the long way.
Things look bad,  we'll come up with something.
We'll have to drop,  head to Bill and Frank's.
ROAD ATLAS
Stock up on anything we may need.
THE BILLBOARD BOOK  OF NUMBER 1 HITS
We leave after dark. Stay with the kid.
Wait. Why do I have to-- Tess.
B/F
60 - NOTHING IN
70 - NEW STOCK
80 - X
So, who's Bill and Frank?
The radio's a smuggling code, right?
60s song, they don't have anything new,
70s, they got new stuff.
What's '80s?
What are you doing?
-Killin' time.  -Well, what am I supposed to do?
I'm sure you'll figure that out.
Your watch is broken.
You mumble in your sleep.
I've never been on the other side  of the Wall.
Look how dark it is.
You guys go out there a lot?
-I guess.  -When was the last time?
Maybe a year. What's it matter?
But you know where to go.
So we're gonna be okay.
Yeah.
So what's the deal with you anyway?
You some kinda  bigwig's daughter or somethin'?
Something like that.
The radio came on when you were sleeping.
What?
What was the song?
He kept sayin', like,
"Wake me up before you go-go"?
Shit.
Gotcha.
80s means trouble.
Code broken.
Listen--
The spot under Lancaster looks good.
-You got a jacket in your pack?  -Yeah.
Okay, get it. It's time to go.
<i>...mandatory curfew</i>  <i>to fight infection and insurrection.</i>
<i>Observe mandatory curfew</i>
<i>to fight infection and insurrection.</i>
WELCOME
Holy shit. I'm actually outside.
-Jesus Christ.  -Shit.
Okay, we're gonna take the left edge  around the buffer zone.
You stay close and you follow my lead.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Let's go.
What the hell?
Hey, hey! Don't, don't, don't move.
Don't move!
You gotta be shittin' me.
-Okay, let's talk this out.  -Turn around.
-Hold on--  -Get on your fuckin' knees.
Get on your fuckin' knees!
-Now hold on--  -What did I fuckin' tell you, man?
I said stay the fuck home.
Get on your knees!
Just get on your knees,  just get on your knees.
Listen, you let us do this run,
we'll split the cards with you.
-Will you?  -Yeah.
I'm so blessed.
Hands on your head. Eyes forward.
Hands on your head!
-Really, man?  -Yep. We're doin' this by the book.
Jesus Christ.
All right. What about three-quarters?
Unauthorized exit.
They'll hang you for that.
Fine. Everythin' off of this run,
-and half off on all of the pills.  -Half off?
All off.
Risk my job for half off.  Outta your fuckin' mind--
Ellie, Ellie!
-Ellie, what the--  -Fuckin' bitch!
Fuck!
Get out of the fuckin' way!
We can fix this.
Move.
Move.
No, no! No, I'm not sick!
-Joel! Joel, Joel!  -I am not sick! I'm not sick!
Look! Look! This is three weeks old.
Nobody lasts more than a day!
Does this look a day old to you?
-You would've killed me!  -I should fucking kill you!
-When did it happen?  -It doesn't matter! You have to trust me!
They're gonna catch us if we don't run!
Joel, we gotta move. We gotta move, Joel!
Joel!
