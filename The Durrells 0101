Hello. Bournemouth 2353.
Yes, Gerald Durrell is my son.
Gerry?
Mrs Durrell...
You have just caned my son!
In a just society, you would   be tied to a tree and whipped for beating an innocent child!
He would rather feed the rats behind the   cricket pavilion than attend his classes.
Yes, because he's been bullied,
ever since arriving at   this pitiful school!
And why do you think that is, dear?
Because... he's a bit different.
That's why children are   bullied, you moron.
It's easy to see where   his incivility comes from.
Don't use that language!
Don't instruct me. I am not   one of your witless flunkies.
No offence, I'm sure   you would be lovely...
if you were allowed to be.
The purpose of education is to   draw the best out of children,
not to beat fear into them.
A father would no doubt have ironed   out more of their shortcomings.
I look forward to a letter of apology.
Oh, he won't be returning.
I'd rather he were taught by monkeys.
Mum, I'd love that. Can we do that?
Don't be daft, Gerry.
Ow!
What do you mean, I'm a bit different?
How could you have stood by and   let me become an estate agent?
I am a writer.
You don't actually write,   though, do you, darling?
- Yes, I'm a fashion model.   - Fighter pilot.
Oh, by the way, I've left school.
No, you haven't.
If Gerry can do it, so can I.
Anyway, I've taken my uniform into the garden and shot it, so...
I might as well leave too. I'm   as thick as two short planks.
As soon as I can find   a husband, I'll be off.
What is the matter with all of you?
Roger?
Here he is, the unteachable   leading the untrainable.
We should go to Corfu.
I've been.
Corfu Castle. I'm not going   back till they put a roof on it.
It's CORFE Castle, darling.
Jesus, Margo! No, Corfu's a Greek island!
I told you I was dim.
Darling, you are NOT dim!
You're 16. What's all   this about a husband?
My friend Donald lives in Corfu.
He says it's dirt cheap,   so I can write there,
full of disgusting animals for Gerry   and, Leslie, you can shoot them.
- Hey, Margo...   - I'll pack.
We are not going anywhere.
We can't just run away from our problems.
Good afternoon, Mrs Durrell.
Oh! Louisa, please.
Indeed. We widowed folk   must stick together.
You should come and have that sherry.
Yes, I should.
Since I've retired, I've   played a lot of bowls.
Do you play?
If only I had the time...
and the bowls.
Let me speak plainly?
You are an attractive lady   and I am an attractive man.
The children need a father figure...
.. and I'm a big admirer   of boarding schools.
Come on!
Oh!
Hello.
Why are you so miserable?
Perhaps it's because I   thought I was a good mother
and yet all I've managed to do   is bring up one unteachable son,
one psychopath, one   vacuous daughter and you.
What's wrong with me?
And worse than that,   none of you seems happy.
There's no laughter in   this house any more.
A writer shouldn't be happy.   It's counter-productive.
You're not a writer,   darling. You sell houses.
It's a flag of convenience.
What about you? You drink like a fish,
if fish drank gin.
And I know we've got money problems.
There are no secrets in this family.
There are secrets, actually.
Oh, God, you're not dying, are you?
No, I'm not dying.
The secret is...
.. that I can't live like this any more.
When you were all small, it   was like we were on a journey,
always moving forward.
And now we've stopped moving forward
and we are sinking.
So, for once in my life,   Larry, I have decided...
.. to take your advice.
Which advice?
You know, a taxi would probably cost the same as a banana in Bournemouth.
We should start as we mean to go on.
Wanting to kill each other?
Economising.
Look, I can see the village
up ahead. Look.
You are not serious.
Now, look, the house sale   barely covered our debts.
We have no money.
I have a miserly widow's pension.
- You are a miserly widow.   - Be quiet!
And you all earn precisely nothing.
We are not on holiday.
We are here to live like local people,
in joy and togetherness,
without the trappings of   so-called civilisation,
which, as far as I can tell,
basically means cruelty and alienation.
It's going to be wonderful.
Don't talk to him. Everybody   here only speaks Greek, anyway.
- Hi. You peoples want a taxi?   - No.
- Yes.   - Absolutely.
- Where are you going?   - We like walking.
Ignore her. We're going to that   guesthouse in the far, far distance.
- That's a nice motor.   - It's American.
Nothing like it on Corfu.
- Spiros Halikiopoulos.   - Leslie.
- Margo.   - Larry.
I'm... Mrs Durrell.
The mother.
The most important person.
I'll get your luggage.
- Where's Gerry?   - Gerry?
- There's a lizard.   - It's a tree with a lizard on it.
- How could that possibly   be interesting? - Gerry!
You's very pale.
- Yes, we plan to a lot of sunbathing.   - No, we don't.
- It's the main reason we came here.   - No, it isn't.
- How long are you staying?   - We don't know.
But, well, we don't have a   house to go back to in England.
Honest to God, if I wasn't   Greek, I'd like to be English.
Oh. Thank you.
Oh, this must be it.
No, you don't stay here. Too expensive.
Lots of empty houses on the   island. I'll find you one.
Yes. Good.
Mrs Durrells! Come!
Gerry! There's a zoo in the lavatory!
Wow!
I'm sleeping in the lavatory!
I can't believe the Customs   let you through with those.
I just think they know self-defence   is vital in today's unsure world.
- I think you should marry Spiros.   - I don't want to marry again.
- But he was wearing a   wedding ring... - Oh.
.. and he had a photograph of his   wife and children on the dashboard.
I thought that was the Greek royal family.
Why would he have a photo of them?
- Where's the..?   - Oh, there's no electricity on Corfu.
I get some more discounts, Mrs Durrells.
Ah, we really need to get some beds.
Gerry? Gerry? Wellingtons.
- Why?   - The snakes.
Here.
Oh... and this.
- What?   - So you can be seen.
- Mum, I'm sure it's fine.   - There we are.
And er....
don't... do anything.
Bye!
Bye, Mother. See you later.
Oh. Margo!
- Show me.   - What?
You know what.
Margo, this is not Bournemouth.
I know. I presume that's why we're here.
The Greeks can be very conservative.
In my day, young ladies avoided the sun.
Well, in my day, which is now, we don't.
Book?
Good girl. And don't   just use it as a pillow.
Right. Starting now.
At last.
Oh, Leslie, will you help me, darling, with the...
I'm afraid not. I'm too busy.
Erm... kalimera.
Kalimera.
That was excellent. Do   you have any more Greek?
No, we've only been here one day.
Oh. Welcome.
Have you seen one of those before?
- No. - The nest of an Egyptian vulture.
Its party piece is breaking   eggs it wants to eat
by throwing pebbles at them.
It's very rare for birds to use tools.
Oh, sorry, you probably knew that.
No.
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
Do you have kumquats in Hampshire?
I don't think so. It's mainly apples...
.. and cabbage.
Apples are not good in Corfu.
We are pretty sure, in the Bible,   Eve was tempted by a kumquat.
- That's a tiny joke.   - Oh!
How are your creatures?
I can't wait to show my family.
Your optimism is impressive.
I find my interest in wildlife
is regarded by my friends   as a form of madness.
Ooh-ooh!
Dogs jumping like kangaroos!
Always funny.
Good shot, Leslie.
Don't hit your mother.
Larry, come down here and help!
I can't. I'm working!
- Mrs Durrells?   - Oh.
- I bring you Lugaretzia.   - Oh.
Hello. Why?
You need help. Big family, house   pretty, but not so perfect!
Yes, you spotted that. Thank you,   Spiros, but we can't afford help.
- Of course you can. You're English.   - The English come in all kinds,
and we are the poor type.
She's cheap. Part-time, almost free.
Oh, God, I look like some kind of a witch.
No, you don't. Where's Mr Durrells?
Oh, he's dead... selfishly.
So it's just me now,   shouldering the burden.
Like a braying, sexless donkey!
She doesn't understand English, so you   can shout out bad things about her.
I don't want to shout out   bad things about her.
- How cheap is she?   - Lugaretzia...
Shh!
15 drachmas a day.
Welcome.
Erm... she's a little bit hypochondriac.
Oh.
Goodbye, Mrs Durrells.
Oh, darling, what's the matter?
A man shouted at me.
Oh, sweetheart.
Oh...
It's all right. It's just going to   be more different than I thought.
Yes.
Yes, me too.
Don't be so feeble. Go   back and shout at him!
What, so he has an excuse to   throw me into the sea or kill me?
- Oh, have some moral courage.   - Stop it, you two.
When have you ever shown any   moral courage? Whatever that is.
I show moral courage in my writing every day.
What writing?! Get a proper job!
You're an intellectual dwarf.
- Larry, that is cruel.   - At least I'm intellectual.
Your intellect is dwarf-sized!
For God's sake.
Yes, it's very nice, isn't it?  It was my mother's, actually.
It looks like a bullet hole.   Leslie must have nearly shot her.
She's not still going   on about that, is she?
No!
Lugaretzia?
Lugaretzia? Come back!
Leslie, you could have killed her.
It's an airgun. She could get   a flesh wound at worst...
- or lose an eye!   - Or lose an eye?!
Unbelievable! I have been   working like a slave for you.
- Now we've lost my only bit of help.   - There's so many species in the wood.
- I found...   - Gerry!
- Stop them!   - Get them out! Get them out!
Don't stamp on them!
- Let me shoot one of them!   - Don't shoot them!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Where did I go wrong?
How did you all become so vile?
You know what her problem is?
Don't you think we're the problem?
- No.   - Don't be absurd.
She needs a man.
Don't you dare talk about Mother   like that. I'll look after her.
Let me lend you a paper by Freud   called the Oedipus Complex.
I expect that's really   clever, but nobody cares.
The body is built for sex.
Gerry knows. He watched animals mating.
You are obsessed with sex.
At last, we agree on something.
And since I'm not getting any,   at least we can help Mother.
All right, where should we start looking?
We can't just drag men in off the street.
Good afternoon.
- Theo!   - My name is Theo Stephanides.
- Hello.   - Good afternoon.
Gerry kindly invited me for tea.
- For your future discoveries.   - Thank you so much.
- Tea, yes.   - Shall I come back another day?
- No, no, no.   - It's fine.
- Tea...   - Theo?
Are you single?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Good luck.
We couldn't work out   how to heat the water.
Oh, don't worry. I can have tea any time.
Figs with sardines --   that's breaking new ground.
So, can I help unlock any   mysteries about Corfu?
Can you explain why a monk shouted at me
like a lunatic as I was sunbathing?
Maybe you were just lying in his space.
The Greeks used to spend   half their lives naked.
So he has no excuse.
That was the Ancient   Greeks and MALE nudity.
Female bodies were more often   shown partially clothed.
Well, there you go, then.
Become a man or wear a   coat over your bikini.
There's one rule for men and   one for women, isn't there?
Have you only just noticed?
I've been busy growing up.
How long has this been going on?
Even Aristotle, who was no slouch,   placed women some way below men...
but above slaves. Hurrah!
Are there any more biscuits, Margo?
Get them yourself!
So, Theo...
you are not married yet.
What do you look for in a woman?
Oh!
Someone I can exchange ideas with,
discuss scientific advances
and just sit quietly with.
Oh!
- Yeah, no, that won't work.   - No.
Theo came for tea.
Well, not tea, but he gave me this,
which I filled with dormice.
Oh, Gerry.
We told Leslie he can't   shoot near the house any more
because Larry can't write   and he might kill us.
So he's going off round   the island tomorrow.
Come on.
Ooh! Getting quite big, aren't you?
Yes. Should I get off?
No.
You can get off now. I can't feel my legs.
Any recommendations?
Hm... Avoid the food.
Stick to the booze.
A fellow foreigner, huh?
Yes,
although I consider myself   a citizen of the world.
You look like you've been around.
Hm.
Sailed the seven seas.
Do you have a favourite?
Hated all of them!
Treacherous, cold...
wet.
Generally devoid of women.
I am dressed perfectly respectably,
unlike Ancient Greek   men, from all accounts.
And I'm entitled to be here.
I think you should take a   break from sunbathing...
I am not going to be put off...
.. because your face looks like a tomato.
Oh!
Exciting news!
Why are you speaking quietly?   You never speak quietly.
Because I don't want Mother to hear.
God, why is everyone so dim?
She's gone to the bank to see   if the money's arrived yet.
Fortunately, we won't starve.   I've shot this beauty.
She won't need her own   money if this works out.
I've found her a man.
- No? Who?   - His name's Captain Creech.
Cracking sense of humour. Stories to tell.
Doesn't beat about the bush and,   well, he must have a few quid.
This will go horribly wrong, you know.
- How will you get them together?   - I might leave it a few weeks.
Her monthly's coming up and   she'll be more volat...
Stop saying these things!   You are such a...
The money's arrived from   the sale of our furniture.
It's not much, but it might make   us feel a bit more like we belong.
For Easter.
- Parakalo.   - Efharisto.
How are you feeling, Mother?
Well... happier.
Still livid that you   drove Lugaretzia away.
And... hormonally?
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm bringing a pal over   for supper tonight.
- Your age, as it happens.   - Oh.
Well, our first guest.
What shall I cook? It will   have to be mainly figs.
Right, I'm off for the day.
Did anyone notice anything   different about Leslie?
I try not to look at him.
- He is becoming very handsome.   - He really isn't.
He left without a gun.
I've never seen him without a gun.
God bless you.
I didn't take a firearm this morning   because I'm over all that now.
Oh. Oh, I'm so glad, Leslie.
I just like exploring the island,
you know, with a dictionary.   Talking to the locals.
What's really going on?   Have you shot someone dead?
Don't be silly, Margo.
He's just growing up.
Besides, it's the 1930s, darling.
People don't need guns any more.
Mother, this is Captain Creech.
He's been looking forward to meeting you.
Well... Mrs Durrell.
With a face like that, you   should be on the front of a ship.
Oh, thank you.
A present for the house --
a bottle of the finest rum from Jamaica.
Have you er... ever been to Jamaica?
No, no, I haven't.
The first place I ever caught gonorrhoea.
So... there we were,
a dozen Uruguayan strumpets below deck
and a ripping wind, straight out   of the arsehole of the Earth.
My, this is good tucker.
I like a girl who is er...
.. handy in the galley,
as well as in bed.
- Where was I?   - Arsehole of the Earth.
- Ah! - Yes, that's quite   enough of that story.
Gerry, sing us a song. Anything you like.
- Where's your head?   - At the moment, it's pounding.
It's nautical for...
Crapper, dunny,
thunder box.
- I think he means the lavatory.   - Yes.
Yes, I know that... now.
It's round the back.
Excuse me.
(What the hell did you   think you were doing,)
(bringing that filthy old   lecher into our house?)
- He's a breath of fresh air.   - Oh!
This is what happens when   women let men rule the roost.
Get up!
- Bye.   - Oh, Leslie.
What are you doing today?
Just walk around, chat with locals.
Ask for work, so I can   help out with the money.
Oh...
- He's lying.   - I know.
I just thought I'd treat   him like an adult.
What were you treating him like when   you let him have half a dozen guns?
I'm a mother, not a policeman.
I thought it might lead   to some discipline,
make a man of him, with   Daddy not being there.
You'll discover, if   ever you have children...
I am listening. I'm just   going into the garden.
Stupid boy, where are you?
Urgh!
Sodding, bloody...
Larry, please!
I'm sure Virginia Woolf   doesn't swear like a trooper.
Well, her brother didn't remove   the letter X from her typewriter.
Why would Leslie do that?
So I don't write the word   "sex" so much, apparently.
It's all right. I'll get him back.
Did I mention that your arse   should be on the front of a ship?
Don't start that again. We   had quite enough last night.
It's your fault for letting me drink.
Look below the surface --
it's usually the ladies   that cause the problems.
Look, I am astonished that   nobody has murdered you yet.
Now, please leave!
After you've made me a spot of lunch.
Shut up! Use a bloody pencil!
Lugaretzia!
Welcome back.
It's been hell without you.
Son of a bitz.
I see Spiros has been teaching you.
In England, we say "bastard".
Barsto?
- Bastard.   - Barsto.
(Barsto.)
I love him, Mum.
Oh, Gerry, take it outside.
Gerry, take him outside, now!
- He'll escape.   - Not for a while, he won't.
- Gerry?   - There's so much to see.
Eat, then leave.
I'm sorry if I've disappointed you.
I've spent too much time in   the company of uncouth men.
Oh. Well...
thank you.
I'm sorry, I...
Get out!
Fine. I'll just finish my lunch.
Now, you leave...
or I'll shoot you.
No, you won't.
You are in great need of a slap!
Oh, so it's OK for you to   shoot and nearly kill someone?
Yes. Yes, it is.
- Leslie, we told you -- no   more shooting! - It wasn't me!
That is the last time you try to   find me a husband. Is that clear?
Are you sure? I met a fascinating   Turk in a bar in town.
And how did you think I would fall for...
Popeye the bloody Sailor Man?!
And he's not "my age"!
We think the sex will calm you down.
God!
Your father was the love of my life,
and I don't want or need   a pale imitation of him.
Well, I find that rather sad.
You may have given up...
but we haven't.
Ooh!
Oh, where have you been?
I was following Leslie and I got lost.
I tried to ask the way home, but   nobody's bothered to learn English.
Anyway, Leslie's lost his interest in guns
because he's got a girlfriend.
A what?
I found him with a local   girl, kissing and worse.
Oh!
Well, maybe it was a good idea   to come out here after all.
I mention wanting a boyfriend,
and you call me empty-headed and sex-mad.
But Leslie finds someone, and he's a hero?
Firstly, Margo, I am thrilled   that you are thinking for yourself
- and highlighting double standards.   - Thank you.
And secondly...
don't you dare be so   bloody rude to your mother.
Good, I'll find myself a man, then.
Hello, Luga. Glad you're back.
This short story is genius.
- Oh? Who wrote it?   - Me.
Look who I find walking home!
Mum.
Gerry, you have a spider, two   dormice, a tortoise and a family.
You do not need a pelican.
- Let it go.   - I will after I've studied it.
It's not funny, Spiros.
No, of course not.
Come on, Gerry, we'll make a zoo cage!
Larry, we need to talk about your writing.
We'll deal with you being   a peeping Tom later.
I'm sorry you don't like   it, but I refuse to let...
No, it's brilliant.
But why is the mother so horrible?
Everything isn't about you.
Oh, nothing is about me.
My life is devoured by my children.
In 21 years I haven't thought about   myself for five consecutive minutes.
But it's good, isn't it?
Did you like the ending?
Yes, Larry, it's very good.
You're going to make us very proud.
In this family?
You're going to make us mildly   pleased in a complicated way.
Come and look at this.
The rocks, just by the chapel.
Oh!
That's my girl.
Hello!
Mrs Durrell?
Theodore Stephanides.   Delighted to finally meet you.
I suspect you need a cross-piece there.
Here.
I believe it's called erm... a purlin.
Leslie, what's your new girlfriend's name?
How do you know about her.
I know everything,   darling. I'm your mother.
She's called Alexia.
It's the loveliest name.
And if you ever want to type it,   you'll have to give Larry his X back.
To koritsi mou,
i Alexia einai...
Leslie!
Why are you so good to us, Spiros?
We have no money. We argue all the time.
We have a word, philoxenia.
It means "love to strangers".
That is so sweet.
And it's clear you need help.
Sodding, bloody!
Lugaretzia, how do you say this in Greek?
That is my revenge on you, Leslie.
An X for an X.
I just made them look less violent!
Does anyone live here?
Oh!
Somebody died?
My friends Donald and Max.
I invited them over.
Oh.
Gosh, who's this?
I went to the bank again today.   Still no sign of our money.
We're going to have to   get jobs, aren't we?
Why are they putting the table in the sea?
It was Leslie's idea.   He doesn't have many.
How dare you!
- Yia sas.   - You too.
Leslie!
It's my eldest boy.
Please, help us.
