Looks like the Royal Capital's in sight.

This is our hero party's triumphant
return.

I am sure they are all excited,hm?

I'll have to find a job once I'm back...

You're already considering such a thing?

It's critical.

Even though we've defeated the Demon King,life doesn't
end here.

Ourlife stretches far beyond this.
It's critical.
I suppose you make a point.
Frieren.
The road ahead for you is so long
that it's beyond our imagination,
hm?

Perhaps.

You've done well defeating the Demon King.

A Peaceful era will now dawn upon this world.

It seems the King is going to get statues of us erected in the plaza.

Well,I have strong doubts on whether or not they'll be able to faithfully reproduce a handsome man like me though.

He is a calculating man. Especially considering that we were only given ten coppers when we set off on our voyage

Now now. Frieren.

We can drink alcohol for free now,so is that not more than enough?

You Corrupt Priest.

...It's all over hm?

This marks the end of our adventure.

Ten years, hm...?

A lot has happened in that time, has it not?

Even on the day of departure, Himmel and Eisen were going to be executed for being impertinent to the King

Had we not been carefulour adventure would've ended then and there, wouldn't
it?

There were also times when Heiter would be totally useless after getting a hangover,
hm?

And that would happen to him once every week.

On that noteI was outstanding-

We considered leaving you behind when you got gobbledup by a mimic.

It seems we've only ever had ridiculous memories

But still, it was fun.

I'm gladI could adventure with
you all.

It was short though.

It was ten yearsyou Know?

Look at Heiter.

He's totally reaching that age.

How rude.

He's been like that since the beginning hasn't he?

How rude

It won't be long now, will it?

The "Era Meteors," I believe they are called.

Ameteor shower that happens once every fifty
years.

Aperfect beginning to a peaceful
era.

How majestic.

It's hard to see in town, isn't it?

There are people here'having a moment. Try reading the mood.

Well then, next time.

Fifty years later.

I know a place where we can witness it even more beautifully,

SoI'lI take you all there.

it's nothing.

let's all watchit together.

Well then, I will take my leave from
here.

What are you going to do after this?

I'm going to continue acquiring magic.

Since I plan to explore the central provinces for a century.

But well,Ill occasionally show my face around here.

We cannot Perceive anelf's feelings, hm?
T

Just how long has she been alive, I wonder?

Even if fifty or a hundred years pass, it's probably just another day to her.

Darkness Dragon horns?

I don't deal in those here.

...Is that so.

That's concerning..

Come to think of it,the one I found in the Demon King's
V
castle,

I believe Ileft it in Himmel's Possession.

It's almost time for the Era Meteors,

so maybe
I'll take this opportunity to drop by and pick
it up...

The townscape's changed considerably since Iwas last here,
huh...?

You're all decrepit now...

Isn't that a bit harsh?

Aren't I still rather handsome despite growing
old?

...Andhere I thought I wouldn't be able to see you ever
again. 1

The Era Meteors, huh...?How nostalgic.

Also, about the thing I found in the Demon King's castle...

The Darkness Dragon's horn,you mean.

Since an ominous aura's been seeping out of that drawer since forever
ago.

I haven't forgotten about it for even a moment.

It would've been perfectly fine if you had just thrown it into some
shedand yet...

I can't do that.

For you,you may have left it to me without thinking much
of it but...

For meit is treasure that my beloved comrade left to me for safekeeping

V
It's something that I'd eventually return to you like
this.

It's not that big of a deal, though...

Himmel, are you ready yet?

You're bald now, so there's no point fussing over it.

Even baldies have to maintain their look.

...Well then, shall we go watch the Era Meteors?

You've become a lot more dignified, Heiter.

That is because Iam a bishop at the Holy City now.

You have not changed a a one bit,
hm? na

Don't stroke my head.

Eisen hasn't changed much,
has he? .,

Is that so.

So that's how it seems.

Well,where is this place that you said we could get a nice view
from?

Are we going now?

I believe it is still a little early until the Era Meteors,
though...

Since it is a week's walk from here...

That far, huh?

Good lord...

That's elder abuse.
I

How nostalgic. It feels like we've gone back to
those days.

We ventured to many
places, didn't we?

Everything sparkled to my eyes like new.

And my comrades were always a part of those beautiful
memories.

had been hoping for a day like this
where we could all reconnect.

So thank you, Frieren.

Because of you,we managed to have a really fun adventure in the end.

How majestic.

I believe that Himmel was happy.

That Girl's one of
Himmel-sama's comrades?

Not showinG a hint of sonrow..

How heartless.

Now now we have not been, either.

Hahaha. How harsh.

...But I... don't know a thing about this
man...
I

I simply travelled
together with him for ten
years...

..Even thouGh I knew a human's lifespan is short...

"Why did Inever think aBOut GettinG to know him More...?

Don't stroke my head...

Well then, Ithink I will return to the Holy City as
well.

You two should show your face
more.

Since this may be your last chance.

Are you
ill?

It seems my years of chronic drinking have caught up to me

God is smiting you.

If you ever stop by the Holy
city,

please offer my grave some alcohol.

...You aren't afraid of death, Heiter?

We are the hero party that saved the worid.

We will definitely live luxuriously up in Heaven during our afterlife

It is for that sake

that I chose to fight alongside you people

...You Corrupt Priest.

Hahaha.

I should get going now too.

On your voyage to acquire magic?

Yes. Well that's one thing,
but...

I think I am going to get to know humans better as
well.

Also, there's something I'd like to ask of you...

I'ma mage, so...

It would be a great help to have a powerful vanguard with me.

Please forgive me.

I'mno longer at an age capable of wielding
an axe.

Don't be so surprised,
Frieren.

Surprisingly, the days pass
by slower once you grow old.

...ls that so.

Well then, farewell.
